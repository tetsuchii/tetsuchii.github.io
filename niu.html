            <h2>About the Project</h2>
            <p>
                The Hungarian National Innovation Agency already had a Hungarian Innovation Ecosystem Map with a very
                simple and
                early-stage user interface. They had a call for tenders to redesign the site and make it more intuitive
                and interactive
                to make it easier and more fun to use. We applied as a team with Hajnal Mészáros, Luca Sára Kiss and
                myself and worked
                on the project together.

            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <div>
                <p>When we started to investigate the old design of the map, we identified many pain points where the
                    use and navigation of
                    the map was confusing for users. In order to understand how to develop a new concept, we collected
                    the patterns that did
                    not work well and that we wanted to avoid. These patterns were the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Identical appearance of clickable and non-clickable elements.</li>
                    <li>Unclear hierarchy and grouping of information.</li>
                    <li>Information noise, difficult to find the relevant information and the connection between them.
                    </li>
                    <li>Intrusive popups lacking meaningful information.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
        <blockquote class="citate">
            “Our goal was to eliminate popups and present all essential information directly on the screen, using
            engaging yet
            unobtrusive interactions and animations to ensure a seamless and enjoyable map experience.”

            <p>As mentioned earlier, the Hungarian Innovation Ecosystem Map already existed, so our task was to redesign
                it. To
                highlight our work and the changes, I've put the old and new versions side by side.</p>

    <!-- Wireframes Section -->
    <section id="project" class="section">
        <div class="text-content-center">
            <h2>Changes in the UI</h2>
            <p class="text-content-center">Here are some of the initial changes we made to the UI of the map. I cut out
                the different sections to better show our solutions and the original problems.</p>
            <h3>Hero section, actors of the ecosystem</h3>
            <div class="comparison-grid">
                <div class="comparison-row">
                    <div class="comparison-column">
                        <img class="grid-item" src="images/niu/s3-old.png" alt="Old version">
                        <p class="comparison-text">
                            In the old version, it was really hard to recognize the actors' relations within the
                            ecosystem
                            and their hierarchy. It wasn't clear which element was clickable, and even if you guessed
                            correctly
                            and clicked on an actually clickable element, an almost full-screen modal popped up with
                            some info
                            and a link.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="comparison-column">
                        <img class="grid-item" src="images/niu/s3-new.png" alt="New version">
                        <p class="comparison-text">
                            In our solution, we used the size and opacity of the elements to show how significant each
                            ecosystem unit is. We also brought closer the units that are connected to each other.
                            Clicking on an
                            element enlarges it to display details about the actor/unit along with a link to their
                            website.
                            Additionally, we added navigation to make it easier to find other sections, such as
                            strategic
                            indicators,
                            financing options, and the ecosystem.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <h3>Strategic indicators</h3>
                <div class="comparison-row">
                    <div class="comparison-column">
                        <img class="grid-item" src="images/niu/indicators-old.png" alt="Old version">
                        <p class="comparison-text">
                            In the old version, it looked like this section was merged with the introduction of the
                            ecosystem players. This section
                            is absolutely not clickable, but because it looked like the section above, it was not clear
                            to the user.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="comparison-column">
                        <img class="grid-item" src="images/niu/indicators-new.png" alt="New version">
                        <p class="comparison-text">
                            In the new version, we tried to make this text-heavy section more consumable and
                            understandable by using icons. We got
                            rid of the centre-aligned text and made lists to make it easier to understand what goes
                            together and how.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <h3>Services and funding opportunities</h3>
                <div class="comparison-row">
                    <div class="comparison-column">
                        <img class="grid-item" src="images/niu/finance-old.png" alt="Old version">
                        <p class="comparison-text">
                            In the old version, if the user wanted to check what kind of funding option they could have,
                            they had to choose from two
                            drop-down menus, and only after that could they see the funding options they could go for.
                            As a user, you had to choose
                            from both drop down menus, if you chose your preference from only one, there was no listing
                            of available funding. So,
                            for example, if you were looking for financial support for start-ups, only after selecting
                            from the second drop-down box
                            could you see that you were in the implementation phase. </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="comparison-column">
                        <img class="grid-item" src="images/niu/finance-new.png" alt="New version">
                        <p class="comparison-text">
                            In the new version, we went for a visual approach: by default, you could see all the
                            available support options, and the
                            size and opacity showed the probability that the option would be good for the user. (On the
                            right, the user can filter
                            in a visual and entertaining way. Again, we got rid of the pop-ups and used the same method
                            as for the actors above:
                            when you click on an element, it gets bigger and shows the details and a link that takes the
                            user to the right website.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <h3>Ecosystem</h3>
                <div class="comparison-row">
                    <div class="comparison-column">
                        <img class="grid-item" src="images/niu/ecosystem-old.png" alt="Old version">
                        <p class="comparison-text">In the old version, the user could not see the whole ecosystem at
                            once, which made it quite
                            difficult to remember which
                            column represented what. To get more information about a device, the user had to click on it
                            and a pop-up would appear
                            on the screen, as usual. So the same problems occurred as mentioned above. </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="comparison-column">
                        <img class="grid-item" src="images/niu/ecosystem-new.png" alt="New version">
                        <p class="comparison-text">
                            In the new version, we tried to create an interactive screen to explore the ecosystem. There
                            is no need to scroll, you
                            can see everything on the screen and with the navigation on the left it is easy to find your
                            way around. To see how it
                            works, we suggest you watch the video below. </p>
