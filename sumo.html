            <h2>About the Project</h2>
            <p>
                I got the chance to build a sumo robot and prepare for the Robotex International competition. This was
                the first time I
                had experimented with electronics and hardware, as well as figuring out how to build something physical.
                There were many
                different types of competition to choose from, and I chose the Mini Sumo category because it just felt
                so exciting to
                try and build my own Autonomus fighter robot. In the end, I unfortunately couldn't take part in the
                competition for
                administrative reasons, but it was a formative experience for me.</p>

            <div>
                <p>
                    To make a sumo robot, I first had to understand the concept of sumo. There are many categories with
                    different
                    objectives, but in the Mini Sumo category, the objective is to push the opposing robot out of the
                    ring without leaving
                    it. The detailed rules can be found here: <a href="https://robotex.international/mini-sumo/">Click
                        here!</a>

        <div class="text-content-center">
            <h2>Design process</h2>
            <p>First I had to understand the basics of electronics, so I started with some smaller tasks, like blinking
                LEDs and
                connecting them to the integrated button on the Arduino board. I used the Arduino Uno board for this
                project because
                it's the best board for beginners, as it's very easy to use.</p>
            <p>After the first steps I was slowly getting an idea of what sensors and accessories I would need, so I
                started to test every unit.</p>
            <h3>The needed units were the following:</h3>

            <p>As mentioned earlier, the Hungarian Innovation Ecosystem Map already existed, so our task was to redesign
                it. To
                highlight our work and the changes, I've put the old and new versions side by side.</p>

    <!-- Wireframes Section -->
    <section id="project" class="section">
        <div class="text-content-center">
            <h2>Changes in the UI</h2>
            <p class="text-content-center">Here are some of the initial changes we made to the UI of the map. I cut out
                the different sections to better show our solutions and the original problems.</p>
            <h3>Hero section, actors of the ecosystem</h3>
            <div class="comparison-grid">
                <div class="comparison-row">
                    <div class="comparison-column">
                        <img class="grid-item" src="images/niu/s3-old.png" alt="Old version">
                        <p class="comparison-text">
                            In the old version, it was really hard to recognize the actors' relations within the
                            ecosystem
                            and their hierarchy. It wasn't clear which element was clickable, and even if you guessed
                            correctly
                            and clicked on an actually clickable element, an almost full-screen modal popped up with
                            some info
                            and a link.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="comparison-column">
                        <img class="grid-item" src="images/niu/s3-new.png" alt="New version">
                        <p class="comparison-text">
                            In our solution, we used the size and opacity of the elements to show how significant each
                            ecosystem unit is. We also brought closer the units that are connected to each other.
                            Clicking on an
                            element enlarges it to display details about the actor/unit along with a link to their
                            website.
                            Additionally, we added navigation to make it easier to find other sections, such as
                            strategic
                            indicators,
                            financing options, and the ecosystem.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <h3>Strategic indicators</h3>
                <div class="comparison-row">
                    <div class="comparison-column">
                        <img class="grid-item" src="images/niu/indicators-old.png" alt="Old version">
                        <p class="comparison-text">
                            In the old version, it looked like this section was merged with the introduction of the
                            ecosystem players. This section
                            is absolutely not clickable, but because it looked like the section above, it was not clear
                            to the user.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="comparison-column">

                        <p class="comparison-text">
                            In the new version, we tried to make this text-heavy section more consumable and
                            understandable by using icons. We got
                            rid of the centre-aligned text and made lists to make it easier to understand what goes
                            together and how.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <h3>Services and funding opportunities</h3>
                <div class="comparison-row">
                    <div class="comparison-column">
                        <img class="grid-item" src="images/niu/finance-old.png" alt="Old version">
                        <p class="comparison-text">
                            In the old version, if the user wanted to check what kind of funding option they could have,
                            they had to choose from two
                            drop-down menus, and only after that could they see the funding options they could go for.
                            As a user, you had to choose
                            from both drop down menus, if you chose your preference from only one, there was no listing
                            of available funding. So,
                            for example, if you were looking for financial support for start-ups, only after selecting
                            from the second drop-down box
                            could you see that you were in the implementation phase. </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="comparison-column">
                        <img class="grid-item" src="images/niu/finance-new.png" alt="New version">
                        <p class="comparison-text">
                            In the new version, we went for a visual approach: by default, you could see all the
                            available support options, and the
                            size and opacity showed the probability that the option would be good for the user. (On the
                            right, the user can filter
                            in a visual and entertaining way. Again, we got rid of the pop-ups and used the same method
                            as for the actors above:
                            when you click on an element, it gets bigger and shows the details and a link that takes the
                            user to the right website.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <h3>Ecosystem</h3>
                <div class="comparison-row">
                    <div class="comparison-column">
                        <img class="grid-item" src="images/niu/ecosystem-old.png" alt="Old version">
                        <p class="comparison-text">In the old version, the user could not see the whole ecosystem at
                            once, which made it quite
                            difficult to remember which
                            column represented what. To get more information about a device, the user had to click on it
                            and a pop-up would appear
                            on the screen, as usual. So the same problems occurred as mentioned above. </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="comparison-column">

                            In the new version, we tried to create an interactive screen to explore the ecosystem. There
                            is no need to scroll, you
                            can see everything on the screen and with the navigation on the left it is easy to find your
                            way around. To see how it
                            works, we suggest you watch the video below. </p>
