            <p>
                I got the chance to build a sumo robot and prepare for the Robotex International competition. This was
                the first time I
                had experimented with electronics and hardware, as well as figuring out how to build something physical.
                There were many
                different types of competition to choose from, and I chose the Mini Sumo category because it just felt
                so exciting to
                try and build my own Autonomus fighter robot. In the end, I unfortunately couldn't take part in the
                competition for
                administrative reasons, but it was a formative experience for me.</p>

            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    To make a sumo robot, I first had to understand the concept of sumo. There are many categories with
                    different
                    objectives, but in the Mini Sumo category, the objective is to push the opposing robot out of the
                    ring without leaving
                    it. The detailed rules can be found here: <a href="https://robotex.international/mini-sumo/">Click
                        here!</a>

        <div class="text-content-center">
            <h2>Design process</h2>
            <p>First I had to understand the basics of electronics, so I started with some smaller tasks, like blinking
                LEDs and
                connecting them to the integrated button on the Arduino board. I used the Arduino Uno board for this
                project because
                it's the best board for beginners, as it's very easy to use.</p>
            <p>After the first steps I was slowly getting an idea of what sensors and accessories I would need, so I
                started to test every unit.</p>
            <h3>The needed units were the following:</h3>

                        <ul>
                            <li>To move the robot to the opponent.</li>
                            <li>To go reverse if the end of the ring is detected.</li>
                            <li>To help scanning the environment to find the opponent.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>To detect the opponent is not in the way anymore.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="circle-standard">
                    <div class="circle-image" style="background-image: url('/images/sumorobot/reflection-icon.svg');">

                    <div class="circle-label">Reflection detection</div>
                    <div class="circle-description">
                        <ul>
                            <li>To detect the end of the ring. (White border on the black surface.)</li>
                            <li>Save the robot from leaving the ring and loosing the match instantly.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>After recognizing the needed part I could finally move to the strategy of the sumo robot. Inbetween I had
                to build the robot, what was a big challange for me, but I got help from my colleagues at that time.
                (Csaba Szabó, László Iványi and Attila Törő.) So the 3D design was not done by me, but the assembly and
                wiring was done by me under supervision.</p>

            I did some secondary research on best practices for sumo robot strategy. It helped me a lot to find my own
            way of
            programming my robot. The strategy I came up with was the following:
        <ol class="text-content-center">
            <li>Spin around slowly to find the target.</li>
            <li>Go full speed to push the target out of the ring.</li>
            <li>If end of the ring (white border) detected go backwards and turn to a random direction a random amount.
            </li>
            <li>Start again.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Final Deliverables</h2>
        <p class="text-content-center">The final prototype of the robot is shown below. It was cut out of PVC sheets and
            fixed with screws. The angle of the
            distance sensors can be changed by inserting a screwdriver into the front centre hole of the robot. (This is
            useful if
            the opposing robot is shorter).</p>
