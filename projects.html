            <p>
                Phoca is a mobile application designed to support caregivers in managing their well-being while
                taking care of their
                loved ones. Caregivers often face high levels of stress, burnout, and neglect of their own needs,
                which can negatively
                impact their physical and mental health. Phoca helps caregivers by providing them with easy access
                to self-care tools,
                reminders, and resources that enable them to prioritize their own health, ensuring they can better
                care for others.

            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>The question that underpinned my semester's work was how to empower women in rural communities to become
                key players in
                social and economic resilience. I felt that in order to achieve this goal, it was important to recognise
                the phenomenon
                of what we call 'invisible work', which can affect rural women even more because of our social and
                cultural norms.
                A large and significant part of this invisible work is the problem of the sandwich generation, which
                means that these
                women often have to care for both future and past generations, raising children and taking on the role
                of carer for
                their elderly relatives.
                In Hungary, this is partly due to housing problems - there are few homes for the elderly, so prices are
                high - and
                partly to our cultural norms, as mentioned above, which mean that the family is responsible for helping
                an elderly
                relative, and in three quarters of cases this is the responsibility of women.

    <section id="research" class="section">
        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>In order to support my hypotheses and obtain the facts and data mentioned above, I used a variety of research
            approaches, both primary and secondary research techniques, to gain an insight into the topic with a breadth
            and depth
            that helped to highlight the key issues faced by rural women caring for elderly relatives.</p>
        <p>It was an important observation that these people do not identify themselves as carers, they do not give a
            collective
            name to this set of tasks, they simply feel it is their duty for various reasons.</p>
        <p>
            Through this process, I identified four key pain points that provided a deeper understanding of the
            situation and
            inspired me with ideas on how to address and alleviate these issues effectively. </p>
        <h3>These pain points were the
            following:</h3>
