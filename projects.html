            <p>
                Phoca is a mobile application designed to support caregivers in managing their well-being while
                taking care of their
                loved ones. Caregivers often face high levels of stress, burnout, and neglect of their own needs,
                which can negatively
                impact their physical and mental health. Phoca helps caregivers by providing them with easy access
                to self-care tools,
                reminders, and resources that enable them to prioritize their own health, ensuring they can better
                care for others.

            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <div>
                <p>The question driving my semester’s work was how to empower women in rural communities to become key
                    players in social
                    and economic resilience. A crucial aspect to address is the phenomenon of invisible work,
                    particularly
                    for rural women,
                    often intensified by social and cultural norms. A significant part of this invisible work is the
                    sandwich generation,
                    where women are responsible for both raising children and caring for aging parents.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In rural Hungary, retirement homes are not an option for the elderly due to housing issues and
                        high prices.</li>
                    <li>Women are expected to take on caregiving responsibilities, which include personal, social, and
                        emotional
                        support, with minimal external assistance.</li>
                    <li>Cultural norms place the burden of elderly care primarily on women.</li>
                    <li>Caregivers’ mental health is often overlooked, leaving many unsupported and overwhelmed.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This work highlights the need for recognizing and addressing the hidden caregiving burden on
                    rural
                    women.

            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>To support my hypotheses and gather data, I used both primary and secondary research methods to explore
                the challenges
                faced by rural women caring for elderly relatives. A key finding was that they do not see themselves as
                carers but
                rather view these tasks as a duty. This research led to identifying four key pain points, offering
                deeper insights and
                potential solutions.</p>
            <h3>These pain points were the
