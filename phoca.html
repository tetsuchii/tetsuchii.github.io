            <p>
                Phoca is a mobile application designed to support caregivers in managing their well-being while
                taking care of their
                loved ones. Caregivers often face high levels of stress, burnout, and neglect of their own needs,
                which can negatively
                impact their physical and mental health. Phoca helps caregivers by providing them with easy access
                to self-care tools,
                reminders, and resources that enable them to prioritize their own health, ensuring they can better
                care for others.

            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <div>
                <p>The question driving my semester’s work was how to empower women in rural communities to become key
                    players in social
                    and economic resilience. A crucial aspect to address is the phenomenon of invisible work,
                    particularly
                    for rural women,
                    often intensified by social and cultural norms. A significant part of this invisible work is the
                    sandwich generation,
                    where women are responsible for both raising children and caring for aging parents.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In rural Hungary, retirement homes are not an option for the elderly due to housing issues and
                        high prices.</li>
                    <li>Women are expected to take on caregiving responsibilities, which include personal, social, and
                        emotional
                        support, with minimal external assistance.</li>
                    <li>Cultural norms place the burden of elderly care primarily on women.</li>
                    <li>Caregivers’ mental health is often overlooked, leaving many unsupported and overwhelmed.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This work highlights the need for recognizing and addressing the hidden caregiving burden on
                    rural
                    women.

        <h2>Design Process</h2>
        <p class="text-content-center">I used the double diamond design process for this project. The image below shows
            the different parts of the
            process,
            like discovering the problem area, defining the pain points, and then ideating on different solutions to
            find the one to
            narrow it down and work it out to a high fidelity prototype. </p>

            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>To support my hypotheses and gather data, I used both primary and secondary research methods to explore
                the challenges
                faced by rural women caring for elderly relatives. A key finding was that they do not see themselves as
                carers but
                rather view these tasks as a duty. This research led to identifying four key pain points, offering
                deeper insights and
                potential solutions.</p>
            <h3>These pain points were the

            <p>Although there are various software solutions for task management and
                optimization, as well as resources
                for self-care
                and mental well-being, there is no digital product specifically designed to support home caregivers for
                the elderly and
                address their unique needs.</p>
            <h3>Persona:</h3>
            <p>To get a better understanding of the real users and to see them actually using the product, I created
                personas. One of
                them is Erika, whose details are shown below. Imagining her using a product that would help her in her
                daily struggles
                helped me turn my ideas into feasible plans. </p>

            <h3>Ideation map:</h3>
            <p>
                Imagining what she (the persona above) would do and need led me to ideate on the possible features and
                functions of the
                application. (It was previously defined it has to be an application.) The result of the brainstorming
                was the ideation
                map below.
            </p>
            <div class="design-process"><img src="images/phoca/Ideationmap.png" alt="Ideation map"></div>
            <p>
                Before diving into wireframing and prototyping, I had to narrow it down to an actual concept of features
                and functions,
                which were the following:
