            <h2>About the Project</h2>
            <p>
                The topic of my thesis was the use of pose detection with ML Kit (Google’s Machine Learning Kit), which
                recognizes 33
                key points on the human body. I needed a concept that could utilize this functionality, allowing me to
                evaluate its
                usability, complexity, and limitations. I experimented with different logical approaches to recognizing
                poses, but
                ultimately, classification proved to be the most effective solution. Exploring this method allowed me to
                deepen my
                understanding of the topic, which I found particularly engaging.

                <p>
                    Many people prefer working out at home for various reasons, but a common challenge—especially with
                    yoga—is the lack of a
                    professional supervisor to provide guidance, improve technique, and help prevent injuries.

            <h2>Considerations</h2>
            <p class="text-content-center">During the development, I took into account various factors to ensure the
                application would be accessible and usable by
                a wide range of people worldwide. My test device ran the minimum Android version required for Google ML
                Kit, so I made
                sure the application would work seamlessly across all currently used Android versions, and even those
                lower than the
                most recent ones. Today, less than 3% of Android users globally are still on Android 7 or earlier, yet
                my application
                runs smoothly on Android 5, which demonstrates its broad compatibility and reliability.

            <br>
            <p class="text-content-center">
                To enhance safety, users are required to log in to save their personal settings, such as whether they
                are currently
                injured or pregnant. This information helps tailor the yoga experience to their specific needs, as
                certain poses may not
                be recommended or feasible for them due to their condition. While this isn't a perfect solution, it
                reflects a
                thoughtful approach to user safety and demonstrates the effort to create a positive and secure user
                experience. Once the
                settings are saved, and the user returns to the list of yoga poses, only the poses that are considered
                safe for their
                condition will be available.

            <h2>User flow</h2>
            <p class="text-content-center">The user flow in this project was intentionally kept simple, as the primary
                focus was on logistics, mathematics, and
                development. However, it’s still important to showcase how the user interacts with the system, which is
                illustrated
                below. After selecting a yoga pose, the user can choose between two modes: Learn and Practice. In Learn
                mode, the user
                receives immediate feedback—a like symbol—when the pose is performed correctly. In Practice mode, once
                the correct
                position is achieved, a timer starts to track how long the user can maintain the pose accurately.</p>

                screens following each other. The user interface
                wasn’t a priority for this project, and
                unfortunately, even though I wanted to create something more polished, I simply didn’t have the time.

            <h2>Impact</h2>
            <p class="text-content-center">There are so many incredible third-party services that can enhance
                applications, and with the power of
                machine learning,
                we’re now able to solve problems that were once impossible. When I worked on this project (February 2022
                - December
                2022), technologies like ChatGPT hadn’t yet emerged, and image generation was still in its early stages.
                This highlights
                just how rapidly this field is evolving. If such advancements were possible back then, imagine what we
                could achieve
                today. With a bit more development, this application could become the next "Duolingo" for workouts and
                yoga, offering a
                safe, accessible, and free way for people to work out from home, on their own time.

        <p class="text-content-center">The final prototype of the robot is shown below. It was cut out of PVC sheets and
            fixed with screws. The angle of the
            distance sensors can be changed by inserting a screwdriver into the front centre hole of the robot. (This is
            useful if
            the opposing robot is shorter).</p>

            <p class="text-content-center">
                This project was my diploma thesis for a Computer Engineering BSc. Through this experience, I realized
                how
                much I would
                prefer to focus more on planning and design rather than development. Due to time constraints and the
                focus
                on
                functionality, there wasn't much opportunity to create a polished and user-friendly UI. The primary
                challenge was
                addressing the issue of supervision, which ultimately was solved, but the available functions were
                already
                stretched to
                their limits.</p>
