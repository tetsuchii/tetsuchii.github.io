            <h2>About the Project</h2>
            <p>
                I had the opportunity to redesign the website and brand identity for one of the most well-known queue
                management
                companies, with distributors and customers around the globe. The project presented a unique challenge:
                creating a
                digital presence that’s both usable and appealing to a highly diverse, international audience. Since
                their website and
                digital interfaces hadn’t been updated in years, my role extended beyond just refreshing the visuals—I
                also restructured
                how their services were presented to ensure clarity and accessibility. This included working on both the
                visual design
                and the copywriting to communicate their offerings more effectively.

            <div>
                <p>
                    For a long time, the company focused solely on fulfilling orders and developing its software, while
                    neglecting its brand
                    identity and overarching vision. As a result, several issues emerged. Notably, an MLM company from
                    Hong Kong adopted a
                    logo and branding style strikingly similar to theirs, which caused significant confusion among
                    customers. Additionally,
                    the company's website lacked clarity regarding which products were still available or actively
                    produced, and how their
                    services functioned. This ambiguity led to a high volume of inquiries and extra workload for the
                    sales team.

            <h2>Considerations</h2>
            <p class="text-content-center">During the development, I took into account various factors to ensure the
                application would be accessible and usable by
                a wide range of people worldwide. My test device ran the minimum Android version required for Google ML
                Kit, so I made
                sure the application would work seamlessly across all currently used Android versions, and even those
                lower than the
                most recent ones. Today, less than 3% of Android users globally are still on Android 7 or earlier, yet
                my application
                runs smoothly on Android 5, which demonstrates its broad compatibility and reliability.

            <p class="text-content-center">
                To enhance safety, users are required to log in to save their personal settings, such as whether they
                are currently
                injured or pregnant. This information helps tailor the yoga experience to their specific needs, as
                certain poses may not
                be recommended or feasible for them due to their condition. While this isn't a perfect solution, it
                reflects a
                thoughtful approach to user safety and demonstrates the effort to create a positive and secure user
                experience. Once the
                settings are saved, and the user returns to the list of yoga poses, only the poses that are considered
                safe for their
                condition will be available.

            <p class="text-content-center">The user flow in this project was intentionally kept simple, as the primary
                focus was on logistics, mathematics, and
                development. However, it’s still important to showcase how the user interacts with the system, which is
                illustrated
                below. After selecting a yoga pose, the user can choose between two modes: Learn and Practice. In Learn
                mode, the user
                receives immediate feedback—a like symbol—when the pose is performed correctly. In Practice mode, once
                the correct
                position is achieved, a timer starts to track how long the user can maintain the pose accurately.</p>

                wasn’t a priority for this project, and
                unfortunately, even though I wanted to create something more polished, I simply didn’t have the time.

            <h2>Impact</h2>
            <p class="text-content-center">There are so many incredible third-party services that can enhance
                applications, and with the power of
                machine learning,
                we’re now able to solve problems that were once impossible. When I worked on this project (February 2022
                - December
                2022), technologies like ChatGPT hadn’t yet emerged, and image generation was still in its early stages.
                This highlights
                just how rapidly this field is evolving. If such advancements were possible back then, imagine what we
                could achieve
                today. With a bit more development, this application could become the next "Duolingo" for workouts and
                yoga, offering a
                safe, accessible, and free way for people to work out from home, on their own time.

            fixed with screws. The angle of the
            distance sensors can be changed by inserting a screwdriver into the front centre hole of the robot. (This is
            useful if
            the opposing robot is shorter).</p>

            <p class="text-content-center">
                This project was my diploma thesis for a Computer Engineering BSc. Through this experience, I realized
                how
                much I would
                prefer to focus more on planning and design rather than development. Due to time constraints and the
                focus
                on
                functionality, there wasn't much opportunity to create a polished and user-friendly UI. The primary
                challenge was
                addressing the issue of supervision, which ultimately was solved, but the available functions were
                already
                stretched to
                their limits.</p>
