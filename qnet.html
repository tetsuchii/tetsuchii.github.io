            <h2>About the Project</h2>
            <p>
                I had the opportunity to redesign the website and brand identity for one of the most well-known queue
                management
                companies, with distributors and customers around the globe. The project presented a unique challenge:
                creating a
                digital presence that’s both usable and appealing to a highly diverse, international audience. Since
                their website and
                digital interfaces hadn’t been updated in years, my role extended beyond just refreshing the visuals—I
                also restructured
                how their services were presented to ensure clarity and accessibility. This included working on both the
                visual design
                and the copywriting to communicate their offerings more effectively.

            <div>
                <p>
                    For a long time, the company focused solely on fulfilling orders and developing its software, while
                    neglecting its brand
                    identity and overarching vision. As a result, several issues emerged. Notably, an MLM company from
                    Hong Kong adopted a
                    logo and branding style strikingly similar to theirs, which caused significant confusion among
                    customers. Additionally,
                    the company's website lacked clarity regarding which products were still available or actively
                    produced, and how their
                    services functioned. This ambiguity led to a high volume of inquiries and extra workload for the
                    sales team.

            <h2>Brand problems</h2>
            <p class="text-content-center">As seen in the image below, the two logos are quite similar, making it easy
                to confuse them. The first logo belongs to
                the queue management company Q-net, while the second one is for the MLM company Qnet. Q-net has received
                numerous false
                reviews and disappointed feedback regarding Qnet's products and services, highlighting the need for a
                logo change to
                better reinforce the brand's identity.
            </p>
            <p class="text-content-center">
                A complete logo change wasn’t an option for two main reasons: first, a significant amount of hardware
                had already been
                produced with the engraved logo, and second, in the queue management sector, their logo is already
                well-recognized.
                Therefore, a more practical solution was to transform the logo into a combination mark by adding a small
                visual element,
                enhancing its distinctiveness without losing the existing brand recognition.
            </p>
            <div class="design-process">
                <img src="images/q-net/logos.png" alt="Wiring plan">
            </div>
            <p class="text-content-center">
                Another issue was the inconsistent use of color over the years. The logo had appeared in various shades,
                and when the
                question arose whether the rose color could be considered the brand’s primary color, no one could say
                who originally
                chose it—and no one felt strongly about keeping it either. This prompted me to not only look for a
                strong alternative
                for the logo but also to develop an entirely new color palette to refresh and unify the brand identity.
            </p>
            <br>
            <div class="design-process">
                <img src="images/q-net/brand-identity.png" alt="Wiring plan">
            </div>
            <p class="text-content-center">
                The new logo, designed to work alongside the existing typographic logo, was built on two core concepts.
                The first was
                the idea of global human connection, and the second was a visual association with trust and
                security—reflected in a form
                that can also be interpreted as a fingerprint. I aimed to use vibrant, distinctive colors that aren’t
                currently
                associated with either Qnet or any other queue management company in the industry, helping the brand
                stand out with a
                fresh and unique identity.

            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p class="text-content-center">I began the project by conducting interviews with key stakeholders within the
                company to better understand their goals
                for the new brand identity and website. Following this, I carried out a competitor analysis to examine
                how other
                companies in the field communicate—both on their websites and social media platforms. I paid special
                attention to how
                they structure their contact pages and how they present their services and products, as these elements
                were particularly
                important for creating a user-friendly and trustworthy online presence.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Strong brand identity is a standout advantage for companies like Qmatic and Sedco, using
                                consistent fonts, colors, and
                                motion.</li>
                            <li>Q-net (especially q-net.com) lacks a clear and recognizable brand identity, and the
                                design feels dense and overwhelming.</li>
                            <li>Visual clarity and consistency help Qmatic stand out, while Akis and Wavetec still
                                struggle with menu complexity and
                                inconsistent color usage.</li>

                            <li>Most competitors have strong navigation systems, with clear indication of clickable
                                elements (Qmatic, Sedco, Wavetec).</li>
                            <li>Q-net’s website (especially q-net.com) has difficult navigation and a dense layout that
                                can be confusing.</li>
                            <li>Information architecture and menu structure are areas where several competitors

                                struggle.</li>

            <h3>Information architecture:</h3>
            <p class="text-content-center"> To develop a clearer and more effective information architecture, I worked
                closely with the sales team and the head of
                development through a series of workshops and collaborative sessions.
                This process helped us uncover key challenges and requirements, allowing us to create a structure that
                aligns with both
                user needs and business objectives.</p>

            <h2>Wireframes</h2>
            <p class="text-content-center">Collaboration with the sales team was crucial throughout the entire project.
                We held multiple meetings during the wireframing and mockup phases, and I conducted several usability
                tests on both
                low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes. The feedback I received was incredibly valuable and
                highlighted areas where I
                still have room to grow, especially since this was my first real project after completing my Google UX
                course. I’d love
                to share the key insights gained from these usability tests below.
            </p>
            <p class="text-content-center">
                The usability study was conducted in two rounds.
                The first round focused solely on the website, while the second round included both the mobile site and
                the updated
                version. Finding participants who met the desired criteria proved challenging, so the study became more
                of a “what if”
                and role-playing scenario. Despite this, all participants gave their best effort, and we gathered
                valuable and
                insightful feedback.

                    <ul>
                        <li>The feature list was redesigned to look cleaner by showing only the feature names, hiding
                            the details unless the user
                            clicks to reveal them.

                        <li>While this made the page look more minimal and spacious, it created a usability issue —
                            users didn’t realize they could
                            or should click the feature name to see more info, because it wasn't clearly clickable
                            (e.g., no button style, arrow, or
                            hover effect).

                    <ul>
                        <li>The interactive (clickable) elements on the page had inconsistent shapes — some might have
                            been squares, others circles
                            or rectangles.
                        </li>
                        <li>Making all clickable elements the same shape helps users quickly recognize them as
                            interactive.

                        <li>Adding a hover animation would
                            make it even more obvious
                            that these are flipboxes.

                This was my first opportunity to work on a real project for an actual client, and it was a truly
                valuable experience. I
                developed a lot in terms of soft skills—especially in client communication and in collaborating with
                people who aren’t
                familiar with UI/UX or creative processes. I’m really happy I had the chance to work with the great team
                at Q-net; it
                made the experience even more rewarding. </p>
